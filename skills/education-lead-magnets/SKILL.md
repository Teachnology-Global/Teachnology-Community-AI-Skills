# Lead Magnets for Education Entrepreneurs

You help education entrepreneurs create free resources and tools that attract their ideal audience, capture email addresses, and naturally lead toward paid offerings.

## Before Starting

**Check for brand context first:**
If `.claude/brand-context.md` exists, read it. Only ask for what's missing.

Understand:
1. **Audience**: Who specifically are you attracting? (Employed teachers? Recently left? Aspiring course creators?)
2. **Goal**: Email list growth? Community signups? Course waitlist? Webinar registrations?
3. **Resources**: What can you build? (PDF? Quiz? Template? Calculator? Mini-course?)
4. **Funnel**: What comes AFTER they download? (Email sequence? Community invite? Sales page?)

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Solve One Specific Problem
The best lead magnets solve one narrow problem completely. Not "everything you need to know about leaving teaching" but "The 15-Minute Skills Audit: Find Your 3 Most Valuable Non-Teaching Skills."

### 2. Quick Win, Not Quick Read
They should feel different AFTER consuming it. Not just informed. Actually moved forward.

### 3. Natural Bridge to Paid
The lead magnet should make them want more of what you sell. If your course teaches career transition, your lead magnet should give them a taste of that transformation.

### 4. Specific to Your Audience
Generic lead magnets attract generic leads. "Career Change Checklist" attracts everyone. "The Teacher's Exit Planning Checklist" attracts exactly who you want.

|--------|-------------------|------|-------------|-----------------|
| Build effort | Low | Medium | Medium-High | High |
| Perceived value | Medium | High | High | Very High |
| Conversion rate | Good | Very Good | Good | Very Good |
| Lead quality | Medium | High (segmented) | High | Very High |
| Shareability | Medium | Very High | Low | High |

## Lead Capture Best Practices

### What to Ask For
- **Minimum:** Email only (highest conversion)
- **Better:** Email + first name (enables personalisation)
- **Maximum:** Email + name + one qualifying question (for segmentation)

Never ask for phone number, company, job title, or anything that feels invasive. Teachers are privacy-conscious.

### Landing Page Structure

1. **Headline**: Specific outcome they'll get
   - ❌ "Download Our Free Guide"
   - ✅ "Find Your 3 Most Valuable Non-Teaching Skills in 15 Minutes"

2. **What they'll get** (3-5 bullet points)
   - Each bullet is an outcome, not a feature
   - "You'll know exactly which roles match your experience"

3. **Preview** (optional but powerful)
   - Screenshot, table of contents, sample page
   - Makes it feel real and worth their email

4. **Email capture form**
   - Email field + button
   - Button text: "Get the [Thing]" or "Take the Quiz" or "Start the Challenge"

5. **Trust signal**
   - "Join 500+ teachers who've already downloaded this"
   - Or a brief testimonial about the resource

### Delivery
- Instant delivery (don't make them wait)
- Confirmation page: "Check your inbox. While you wait, here's [bonus]"
- Follow-up email within 60 seconds with the download link
- Start nurture sequence 24 hours later

---

## Promotion Strategy

### Where Teachers Hang Out
- Facebook groups for teachers (especially "Thinking of Leaving Teaching" groups)
- Reddit: r/Teachers, r/careerguidance, r/AustralianTeachers
- LinkedIn (education professionals)
- Instagram (education content creators)
- Teacher union newsletters and websites
- Education conferences and PD days

### Promotion Tactics
1. **Blog posts** that naturally lead to the resource
2. **Social posts** sharing one insight from the resource
3. **Pinterest pins** (teachers love Pinterest for resources)
4. **Guest posts** on education blogs
5. **Podcast interviews** with CTA to the free resource
6. **Community sharing** in relevant groups (add value first, don't just drop links)

## Measuring Success

| Metric | What It Tells You |
|--------|-------------------|
| Landing page conversion rate | Is the page compelling? (Target: 20-40%) |
| Email open rate on delivery | Did they actually want it? (Target: 60%+) |
| Resource completion rate | Is it useful? (Track if possible) |
| Nurture sequence engagement | Are they warming up? |
| Conversion to paid | Does it attract buyers? (This is the one that matters) |

The ultimate test: **Does this lead magnet attract people who eventually buy?** A 50% conversion rate on a lead magnet that attracts freebie-seekers is worse than a 15% conversion rate on one that attracts serious career changers.
